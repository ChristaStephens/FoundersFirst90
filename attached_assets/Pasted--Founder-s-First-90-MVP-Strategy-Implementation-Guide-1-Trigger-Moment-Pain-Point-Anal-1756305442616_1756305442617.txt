# Founder's First 90 - MVP Strategy & Implementation Guide

## 1. Trigger Moment & Pain Point Analysis

### **Primary Trigger: "The Monday Morning Paralysis"**

**The Moment**: Sunday night, aspiring founder has spent 3+ hours watching startup YouTube videos, reading blog posts, and browsing Reddit r/entrepreneur. Monday morning arrives and they think: *"Okay, but what do I actually DO today?"*

**Specific Pain Points That Drive Download:**
- **Analysis Paralysis**: "I've researched for weeks but haven't taken one concrete action"
- **Shiny Object Syndrome**: "I keep switching ideas every few days"  
- **Impostor Syndrome**: "Everyone else seems to have a secret playbook I'm missing"
- **Overwhelm**: "There are 1,000 things to do, but I don't know which comes first"
- **Isolation**: "I'm doing this alone and have no accountability"

### **Positioning Strategy: "The First Step" Approach**

**Hero Headline**: *"Stop researching. Start building. Turn your idea into revenue in 90 days."*

**Key Positioning Elements:**
1. **Time-Bound Promise**: 90 days creates urgency and manageability
2. **Action-First**: Emphasizes doing over learning
3. **Revenue Focus**: Concrete outcome, not just "building a business"
4. **Simplicity**: One thing each day, not overwhelming complexity

**App Store Description Hook:**
*"You have the idea. You've done the research. Now what? Founder's First 90 gives you ONE specific action every day to transform your startup idea into a real business with real customers in 90 days. No more analysis paralysis."*

### **Target Moment for App Discovery:**
- **Google Searches**: "how to start a startup step by step", "what to do first when starting a business"
- **Social Media**: Comments on startup success posts asking "but how did you actually start?"
- **Communities**: Posted in entrepreneurship forums when someone asks "I have an idea, now what?"

## 2. Content Delivery Strategy (No Custom Content Required)

### **Content Framework: The "ACTION-FIRST" Model**

Instead of teaching, the app **assigns daily missions** with supporting resources:

#### **Daily Structure:**
```
Today's Mission: [One specific action]
Why This Matters: [2-sentence explanation]
How To Do It: [Simple bullet points]
Resources: [2-3 curated links]
Success Criteria: [How to know you completed it]
```

#### **Content Sources (Zero Content Creation):**

**1. Curated External Resources**
- Link to existing high-quality YouTube videos (5-10 min max)
- Reference established blog posts from known entrepreneurs
- Point to free tools and templates available online
- Embed existing podcasts or interviews

**2. Action-Based Prompts**
- Simple questions that force reflection and action
- Fill-in-the-blank exercises  
- Checklists with checkbox completion
- "Today's 3 Questions" format

**3. Templates & Tools Integration**
- Link to Canva templates for pitches
- Google Docs templates for business plans
- Typeform for customer surveys
- Calendly for customer interviews

#### **Sample Day Content (No Video Creation Needed):**

**Day 7: "Get Your First Customer Feedback"**
- **Mission**: Interview 3 potential customers about your idea
- **Why**: Assumptions kill startups. Real feedback saves months of wasted effort.
- **How**: 1) List 10 people who might use your product 2) Send this message template 3) Schedule 15-min calls
- **Resources**: 
  - [Link] Customer interview script template
  - [Link] YouTube: "How to do customer interviews" (existing video)
- **Success**: Upload photo of your interview notes or summary

## 3. Daily Engagement & Retention Strategy

### **Core Engagement Loop (5-10 minutes daily):**

#### **Morning Ritual (3 minutes):**
1. **Check Today's Mission**: Clear, actionable daily task
2. **Set Intention**: "Today I will accomplish..."  
3. **Start Timer**: Built-in focus timer for the task

#### **Evening Check-In (2 minutes):**
1. **Mission Status**: Did you complete it? (Yes/No + photo proof)
2. **Quick Win**: What's one small thing that went well?
3. **Tomorrow Preview**: See what's coming next (builds anticipation)

#### **Weekly Momentum Builder (5 minutes):**
1. **Progress Dashboard**: Visual week completion rate
2. **Milestone Celebration**: Unlock achievement badges
3. **Reflection Prompt**: "What did you learn about your business this week?"

### **Retention Mechanics (Ranked by Impact):**

#### **1. Streak Psychology (Highest Impact)**
- Daily completion streak counter
- Visual calendar with completed days marked
- Streak recovery: "Don't break the chain" messaging
- Personal best tracking

#### **2. Progress Visualization (High Impact)**
- 90-day progress bar with milestones (Day 30, 60, 90)
- Business health score that improves with task completion
- Before/after comparison: "Day 1 you vs. Day X you"

#### **3. Social Accountability (Medium Impact)**  
- Optional: Share daily wins to social feed
- Find an "accountability buddy" within app
- Leaderboard of most consistent users
- Community challenges: "This week's focus: customer interviews"

#### **4. Micro-Rewards (Medium Impact)**
- Achievement unlocks: "Customer Discovery Champion"
- Progress photos collection: Visual story of their journey
- Unlocked resources: Premium templates after milestones

#### **5. Fear of Missing Out (Low Impact for MVP)**
- "Today's mission expires in X hours" (creates urgency)
- Limited daily missions (can't binge ahead)

## 4. MVP Technical Implementation on Replit

### **Recommended Tech Stack**

#### **Option A: React Native + Expo (Mobile-First)**

- State Management: React Context (simple) or Redux Toolkit  
- Storage: AsyncStorage for local data
- Backend: JSON files initially, then Firebase/Supabase
