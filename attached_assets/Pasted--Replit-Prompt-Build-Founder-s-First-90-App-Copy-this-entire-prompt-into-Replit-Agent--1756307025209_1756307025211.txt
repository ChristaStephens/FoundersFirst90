## Copy this entire prompt into Replit Agent:

---

**Build me a React web app called "Founder's First 90" - a daily habit tracker for entrepreneurs launching their first business. Here are the complete specifications:**

## App Concept & Purpose
Create a daily task app that guides new entrepreneurs through their first 90 days of building a business. Each day presents ONE specific action item to complete, with progress tracking and streak mechanics to maintain momentum. The goal is to transform idea-stage founders into revenue-generating businesses in 90 days through daily action, not education.

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework:** React with functional components and hooks
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Data Storage:** localStorage for user progress (no backend needed initially)
- **State Management:** React useState and useEffect hooks
- **Deployment:** Standard Replit web hosting

## Core Features to Build

### 1. Daily Mission Display
- Shows current day (Day X of 90)
- Displays today's specific mission/task
- Shows mission description and action steps
- Includes 2-3 curated external resource links
- Large "Mark Complete" button that changes state when clicked

### 2. Progress Tracking
- Visual progress bar showing completion percentage (X/90 days)
- Current streak counter (days completed in a row)
- Personal best streak display
- Simple statistics: total days completed, success rate

### 3. Mission Database
Create a JSON file with 15 sample daily missions (I'll expand to 90 later). Each mission should have:
```json
{
  "day": 1,
  "title": "Define Your One-Sentence Business Idea",  
  "description": "Clarity beats complexity. If you can't explain it in one sentence, your customers won't understand it either.",
  "task": "Write one sentence that clearly explains what your business does and for whom.",
  "steps": [
    "Complete this template: 'I help [target customer] achieve [desired outcome] by [your solution]'",
    "Test it on 3 people - can they repeat it back to you?", 
    "Refine until it's crystal clear"
  ],
  "resources": [
    {"title": "Value Proposition Canvas Template", "url": "https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas", "type": "template"},
    {"title": "Crafting Your Elevator Pitch", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b3xG_YjgvI", "type": "video"}
  ],
  "successCriteria": "You have one clear sentence that anyone can understand and remember."
}
```

### 4. User Flow
- **Home Screen:** Current day, today's mission, progress stats, completion button
- **Progress Screen:** Calendar view of completed days, streak tracking, achievement badges  
- **Mission Detail:** Full mission with steps, resources, and completion tracking
- **Simple navigation** between these 3 main screens
